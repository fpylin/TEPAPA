RELEASE HISTORY

Version 0.99  - 7 September, 2020
  * Added survival analysis (logrank)
  * Added option to specify minimum support required (-s) in exhaustive search
  * Bug fixes

Version 0.9   - 29 July, 2017
  * Initial release



1. Overview
===========

TEPAPA  is a  feature  learning  pipeline  that  learns  differentiating  text
patterns associated with outcomes of interest (i.e. supervised) from examples.
It is  specifically designed  to learn  new knowledge  from electronic medical
records (EMR) to find text patterns associated a numeric  and binary variables
of interest (and hopefully explanatory with biological plausibility).

TEPAPA combines the following methods  to discover text patterns that differen-
tiate the outcome variables from EMR text:

  * Semantic-free (i.e. shallow) Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods.
  * Sequence-based feature search methods.
    - Simple n-gram search
    - Combinatorial (deep) search
  * Statistical association testing.
  * Predictive regular expression induction methods
  * Feature filtering tools
  * Feature ranking tools.

TEPAPA is also designed to be extensible.  The preprocessing modules and can be 
replaced by dedicated  and/or more sophiscated tools for preprocessing.  TEPAPA
may also find discriminative text patterns to help machine learning-based pheno-
typing methods for case classification.
  
Please see the associated publications for more detailed descriptions [1].


2. Building TEPAPA
==================
Source tree directory structure:
  src/                           - Source code directory
  src/Makefile                   - Makefile of the TEPAPA binary
  bin/                           - output directory for the binary
  scripts/         
  scripts/prep-*                 - Scripts for preprocessing
  scripts/tepapa-pl-simple.tpp   - Example script for TEPAPA-based discovery


Compilation requirements:
  * GNU make
  * gcc (version 5) - must support C++11
  * libc++ 
  * The following external libraries are needed:
     - libgsl             GNU scientific library
     - libgslcblas        GNU scientific library, BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra 
                          Subprograms)
     - libpthread         GNU POSIX threading Library
  * Perl5
  * The following Perl5 modules (downloadable from CPAN) are required at 
    compile time:
     - ExtUtils::Embed    for embedding Perl in C/C++ applications)


Then run:

   cd src; make


     
3. Running TEPAPA
=================
System requirements:
  * An UNIX-like system (e.g. GNU/Linux).
  * Multiple  processors  will  be  used  in the  pattern  search  and  regular 
    expression induction.
  * Depending on the size of corpus / depth of search, a minimum  of 4GB RAM is 
	  recommended (>16GB is recommended for general use.
  * Computation time is linear to the size of corpus.

Run-time requirements:
  * Perl5 is  used by  the default  text cleaner (prep-CLEAN.pl)  and tokenizer 
    (prep-TOKENISE.pl).
  * Lingua::Stem::En   is   required   for   word   stemming /  tokenization by 
    prep-TOKENISE.pl (the default tokeniser), available at 
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lingua-Stem/lib/Lingua/Stem/En.pm

To run TEPAPA, you need:
  * A list of  cases with  known variable  of interest  (e.g.  risk factors  or 
    patient survival).
  * EMR narratives associated with each case.
  * Compile a case file (see scripts/tepapa-pl-simple.tpp for format).
  * A pipeline script (see scripts/epapa-pl-simple.tpp) for execution.
